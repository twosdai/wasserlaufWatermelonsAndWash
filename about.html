            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2019 by the Wasserlauf family, our business began with
              a simple mission: to provide the cleanest, freshest watermelons in
              Palmyra, NY. What started as a small roadside stand has grown into
              the region's premier destination for premium watermelons and
              professional fruit washing services.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our unique "triple-wash" process was developed after years of
              perfecting our cleaning techniques. We believe that a clean
              watermelon is a happy watermelon, and a happy watermelon makes for
              happy customers.

            <h3>Mr. Melon</h3>
            <p class="role">Sole Proprietor</p>
            <p>
              No one is quite sure where Mr. Melon came from. Some say he was
              raised by a wandering cart of fruit vendors, others claim he
              learned the art of melon selection from a retired circus strongman
              who could judge ripeness by the sound of a single toe tap. He
              appears without warning, exchanging postcards from faraway
              orchards for rumors of legendary seeds, then vanishes just as
              quickly, leaving behind the kind of watermelons that make people
              gasp, weep, and occasionally salute. His suitcase is rumored to be
              full of unusual tools: a copper tuning fork, a pocket rainstorm,
              and a notebook filled with sketches of melons that may or may not
              exist. He is a mysterious figure with a passport full of fruit
              stamps, always traveling the world for the greatest melons.
